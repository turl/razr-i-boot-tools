This is a modified version of turl's tools to pack/unpack images from
https://github.com/turl/razr-i-boot-tools

This version of the tool works with ZTE Grand X In images, which use a 
slightly modified format than the original utilities.

Since ZTE GXI does not store images in separate paritions, a new tool was
added to read the MBR info and dump the referenced images from hidden part 
of /dev/block/mmcblk0 (first 100 MB).

Header checksum and length are recalculated to match modfied image. 

The utilities adapted from original project:

- gxi_unpack - obtain kernel and compressed initrd from image (e.g. stock image from update.zip)
- gxi_pack - modify the image by providing user kernel and initrd image (user may specify image type)

New utility:
- gxi_dump_images_pc - retreive images stored in hidden section of mmcblk0 
- gxi_dump_images_s - static-linked version dumping images directly on phone from /dev/block/mmcblk0

Dynamically-linked binaries (pack, unpack, dump_images), which can be used directly on ZTE 
Grand X In are stored in medfield_bin directory.
